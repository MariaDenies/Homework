    <br><h2>Latitude vs. Humidity</h2><br>
    <p class="mb-0">As you can see, there is also no clear relationship between latitude and cloudiness. 
        Data is very evenly spread. Humidity could have some correlation with cloudiness, but it could be more related with locations, 
        because coastal cities have higher humidity than desert cities.

    <br><h2>Latitude vs. Wind Speed</h2><br>
    <p class="mb-0"> There might be a weak relationship between wind speed and latitude. 
        There seems to be a tendency that when the latitude is farther from the equator, the higher wind speed will be. 
        However since the R-Square is not significantly high, we may need a larger dataset to prove the hypothesis, 
        or we will reject the hypothesis that such correlation does not exist.

    <br><h2>Latitude vs. Temperature</h2><br>
    <p class="mb-0"> As you can see there is a very clear pattern between the latitude and the temperature. 
        When the latitude gets closer to the equator, the temperature will be more likely to increase. 
        However the temperature didn't drop / increase the same ratio as the change in latitude. 
        We can see that the southern hemisphere tends to be warmer, which makes sense because the data was taken in Janurary, 
        which is the southern hemisphere's summer, and its still winter in the northern hemisphere.
